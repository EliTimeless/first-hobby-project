      <h5>Singing theory</h5>
      <div class="text2">
        <em>Singing</em> is a skill that requires highly developed muscle
        reflexes. <em>Singing</em>
        does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree
        of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further
        through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal
        exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including warming up
        the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally
        and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato,
        control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals
        comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal
        faults.
